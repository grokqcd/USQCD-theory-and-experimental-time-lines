\section{Intensity Frontier}\label{sec:intensity}

\subsection{Muon $g-2$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The muon anomalous magnetic moment, or $g-2$, will be measured by the E989 experiment at Fermilab to the one-per=mille precision level and thus offers an exceptional opportunity to test the standard model if theory can match this precision.
    \item[Long term goal.] The Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative aims to provide a consensus theory value at the same level of precision as the E989 experiment. Only QCD, or hadronic, contributions need improvement to reach this goal.
\item[Method.] Lattice  calculations of correlation functions in QCD for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) (two-point) and hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) (four-point) are combined with perturbative QED at $O(\alpha^2)$ and $O(\alpha^3)$, respectively, to obtain the leading hadronic contributions.
\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[2021] Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative whitepaper~\cite{Aoyama:2020ynm} released with consensus Standard Model Value based on data-driven HVP and data-driven+lattice HLbL contributions.
    \item[2021] E989 announces first results with 0.48 ppm precision. Combined with BNL 821 (0.54 ppm), yields 4.2 standard deviation discrepancy with theory.
    \item[2021] BMW collaboration computes HVP contribution to 0.75\%, consistent with experiment. 
    \item[2022] USQCD groups Fermilab Lattice/HPQCD/MILC and RBC/UKQCD, $\chi$QCD, Aubin {\it et al.}, and several groups from Europe obtain agreement on the HVP Window which is four standard deviations discrepant with the data-driven value.
    \item[2023] Several groups to update total HVP contribution, including isospin corrections, with sub-percent errors.
    \item[2023] RBC updated HLbL contribution, reaching 12\% error.
    \item[2023] E989 to announce run 2 and 3 combined result, improving precision by a factor of two.
    \item[2024] RBC to reduce error on HLbL contribution by a factor of two.
    \item[2024-25] RBC/UKQCD and FHM reach 1-2 per-mille goal on HVP contribution. 
    \item[2025-26] E989 releases final result with expected precision of $\sim 1.4$ ppm
%\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{$B$-meson anomalies and CKM unitarity tests}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] $B$-flavor physics offers excellent opportunities for stringent tests of the Standard Model, tests that may lead to the discovery of new physics. In conjunction with refined experimental results, precision lattice-QCD calculations yield precise values of the CKM matrix elements, allowing checks of CKM unitarity and tests of lepton universality. Measurements of rare semileptonic $B$-meson decays (such as $B\to\pi\ell^+\ell^-$, $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$) are promising channels for new-physics searches because their rates are suppressed in the Standard Model.
    \item[Long term goal.] Lattice-QCD calculations go hand-in-hand with experiment.  Thus the long-term goal is to keep pace with the improving experimental precision of each quantity under study.
    \item[Method.] Most calculations work with a combination of hadronic two- and three-point functions, measured at several lattice spacings and quark masses, and with a variety of current operators. 
\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[2014] Calculation of leptonic $B$, $B_s$, $D$, and $D_s$ decay constants to sub-percent accuracy.
    \item[2015] First measurement by CMS/LHCb of the decay $B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$.
    \item[2021] Calculation of $R(D*)$ to 4\%.
    \item[2022] Precise calculation of $|V_{cs}|$ with a QCD error comparable to the current experimental precision and of $|V_{cd}|$ with a QCD error twice that of experiment.
    \item[2024] Calculation of $|V_{cb}|$ to 1\% via $B\to D\ell\nu$ and $|V_{ub}$ to 2\% via $B\to \pi\ell\nu$.
    \item[2024] Calculation of $B\to\pi \ell^+\ell^-$ and $B\to K \ell^+\ell^-$ to 2\%.
    \item[2027] Calculation of $|V_{cb}|$ to the sub-percent level via $B\to D^*\ell\nu$.
    \item[2027] Calculation of $R(D*)$ to 1\%.
    \item[??] Belle II
    \item[??] LHCb
    \item[??] BES III
%\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{$K_L - K_S$ mass difference}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] Precisely measured quantity that has sensitivity to new physics at an energy scale of $10^4$ TeV.
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate $K_L - K_S$ mass difference with
      a precision exceeding the current experimental value of $3.484
      \pm 0.007 \times  10^{-12}$ MeV.
    \item[Method.] Well understood lattice QCD technique with no
      recognized limitation to the control of all systematic
      errors. GIM cancellation is essential and treatment of the
      charmed quark using QCD perturbation theory introduces 36\%
      errors. The lattice calculation is made diﬀicult by the
      requirement of a lattice spacing smaller than the charm quark
      Compton wave length and a volume suﬀiciently large to accurate
      treat physical mass pions. 
\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[2011] Most accurate KTeV measurement.
    \item[2010-2014] Lattice QCD method devised and first results obtained.
    \item[2014-2021] First results with physical masses and $1/a = 2.38$ MeV obtained, presence of large discretization errors recognized.
    \item[2021-2023] Discretization errors under study and evidence of $a^2$ scaling expected.
    \item[2023-2024] Calculation of the long-distance contribution to
      $\varepsilon_K$ with $1/a = 2.38$ MeV will include extension of
      earlier $\Delta M_K$, calculation increasing statistics.
    \item[2024-2026] Calculation of $\Delta M_K$ with $1/a = 2.8$ GeV
      giving continuum limit result with $< 20$\% errors. 
    \item[2027-2030] Move to $2+1+1$ flavors and $1/a = 3.0$, $4.0$
      GeV and possibly 5 GeV with $<10$\% errors.

\section{Nuclear structure}\label{sec:nucstruct}

\subsection{Structure of light nuclei}

\begin{itemize}  
    \item[Motivation.] Much is known about the structure of nuclei, but other aspetcs are mysterious when viewed from the point of view of QCD.
