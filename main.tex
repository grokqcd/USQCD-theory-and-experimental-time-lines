\section{Muon $g-2$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The muon anomalous magnetic moment, or $g-2$, will be measured by the E989 experiment at Fermilab to the one-per=mille precision level and thus offers an exceptional opportunity to test the standard model if theory can match this precision.
    \item[Long term goal.] The Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative aims to provide a consensus theory value at the same level of precision as the E989 experiment. Only QCD, or hadronic, contributions need improvement to reach this goal.
\item[Method.] Lattice  calculations of correlation functions in QCD for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) (two-point) and hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) (four-point) are combined with perturbative QED at $O(alpha^2)$ and $O(\alpha^3)$, respectively, to obtain the leading hadronic contributions.
\item[Timeline.]
\begin{itemize}
    \item[2021] Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative whitepaper~\cite{Aoyama:2020ynm} released with consensus Standard Model Value based on data-driven HVP and data-driven+lattice HLbL contributions.
    \item[2021] E989 announces first results with 0.48 ppm precision. Combined with BNL 821 (0.54 ppm), yields 4.2 standard deviation discrepancy with theory.
    \item[2021] BMW collaboration computes HVP contribution to 0.75\%, consistent with experiment. 
    \item[2022] USQCD groups Fermilab Lattice/HPQCD/MILC and RBC/UKQCD, $\chi$QCD, Aubin {\it et al.}, and several groups from Europe obtain agreement on the HVP Window which is four standard deviations discrepant with the data-driven value.
    \item[2023] Several groups to update total HVP contribution, including isospin corrections, with sub-percent errors.
    \item[2023] RBC updated HLbL contribution, reaching 12\% error.
    \item[2023] E989 to announce run 2 and 3 combined result, improving precision by a factor of two.
    \item[2024] RBC to reduce error on HLbL contribution by a factor of two.
    \item[2024-25] RBC/UKQCD and FHM reach 1-2 per-mille goal on HVP contribution. 
    \item[2025-26] E989 releases final result with expected precision of $\sim 1.4$ ppm

\section{$B$-meson anomalies and CKM unitarity tests}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] $B$-flavor physics offers excellent opportunities for stringent tests of the Standard Model, tests that may lead to the discovery of new physics. In conjunction with refined experimental results, precision lattice-QCD calculations yield precise values of the CKM matrix elements, allowing checks of CKM unitarity and tests of lepton universality. Measurements of rare semileptonic $B$-meson decays (such as $B\to\pi\ell^+\ell^-$, $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$) are promising channels for new-physics searches because their rates are suppressed in the Standard Model.
    \item[Long term goal.] Lattice-QCD calculations go hand-in-hand with experiment.  Thus the long-term goal is to keep pace with the improving experimental precision of each quantity under study.
    \item[Method.] Most calculations work with a combination of hadronic two- and three-point functions, measured at several lattice spacings and quark masses, and with a variety of current operators. 
\item[Timeline.]
\begin{itemize}
    \item[2014] Calculation of leptonic $B$, $B_s$, $D$, and $D_s$ decay constants to sub-percent accuracy.
    \item[2015] First measurement by CMS/LHCb of the decay $B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$.
    \item[2021] Calculation of $R(D*)$ to 4\%.
    \item[2022] Precise calculation of $|V_{cs}|$ with a QCD error comparable to the current experimental precision and of $|V_{cd}|$ with a QCD error twice that of experiment.
    \item[2024] Calculation of $|V_{cb}|$ to 1\% via $B\to D\ell\nu$ and $|V_{ub}$ to 2\% via $B\to \pi\ell\nu$.
    \item[2024] Calculation of $B\to\pi \ell^+\ell^-$ and $B\to K \ell^+\ell^-$ to 2\%.
    \item[2027] Calculation of $|V_{cb}|$ to the sub-percent level via $B\to D^*\ell\nu$.
    \item[2027] Calculation of $R(D*)$ to 1\%.
