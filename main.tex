% Tom Blum
\subsection{Muon $g-2$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The muon anomalous magnetic moment, or $g-2$, will be measured by the E989 experiment at Fermilab to the one-per=mille precision level and thus offers an exceptional opportunity to test the standard model if theory can match this precision.
    \item[Long term goal.] The Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative aims to provide a consensus theory value at the same level of precision as the E989 experiment. Only QCD, or hadronic, contributions need improvement to reach this goal.
\item[Method.] Lattice  calculations of correlation functions in QCD for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) (two-point) and hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) (four-point) are combined with perturbative QED at $O(\alpha^2)$ and $O(\alpha^3)$, respectively, to obtain the leading hadronic contributions.
\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[2021] Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative whitepaper~\cite{Aoyama:2020ynm} released with consensus Standard Model Value based on data-driven HVP and data-driven+lattice HLbL contributions.
    \item[2021] E989 announces first results with 0.48 ppm precision. Combined with BNL 821 (0.54 ppm), yields 4.2 standard deviation discrepancy with theory.
    \item[2021] BMW collaboration computes HVP contribution to 0.75\%, consistent with experiment. 
    \item[2022] USQCD groups Fermilab Lattice/HPQCD/MILC and RBC/UKQCD, $\chi$QCD, Aubin {\it et al.}, and several groups from Europe obtain agreement on the HVP intermediate window which is four standard deviations discrepant with the data-driven value.
    \item[2023] Several groups to update total HVP contribution, including isospin corrections, with sub-percent errors.
    \item[2023] RBC updated HLbL contribution, reaching 12\% error.
    \item[2023] E989 to announce run 2 and 3 combined result, improving precision by a factor of two.
    \item[2024] RBC to reduce error on HLbL contribution by a factor of two.
    \item[2024-25] RBC/UKQCD and FHM reach 1-2 per-mille goal on HVP contribution. 
    \item[2025-26] E989 releases final result with expected precision of $\sim 1.4$ ppm

\subsection{$B$-meson anomalies and CKM unitarity tests}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] $B$-flavor physics offers excellent opportunities for stringent tests of the Standard Model, tests that may lead to the discovery of new physics. In conjunction with refined experimental results, precision lattice-QCD calculations yield precise values of the CKM matrix elements, allowing checks of CKM unitarity and tests of lepton universality. Measurements of rare semileptonic $B$-meson decays (such as $B\to\pi\ell^+\ell^-$, $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$) are promising channels for new-physics searches because their rates are suppressed in the Standard Model.
    \item[Long term goal.] Lattice-QCD calculations go hand-in-hand with experiment.  Thus the long-term goal is to keep pace with the improving experimental precision of each quantity under study.
    \item[Method.] Most calculations work with a combination of hadronic two- and three-point functions, measured at several lattice spacings and quark masses, and with a variety of current operators. 
\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[2014] Calculation of leptonic $B$, $B_s$, $D$, and $D_s$ decay constants to sub-percent accuracy.
    \item[2015] First measurement by CMS/LHCb of the decay $B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$.
    \item[2021] Calculation of $R(D*)$ to 4\%.
    \item[2022] Precise calculation of $|V_{cs}|$ with a QCD error comparable to the current experimental precision and of $|V_{cd}|$ with a QCD error twice that of experiment.
    \item[2024] Calculation of $|V_{cb}|$ to 1\% via $B\to D\ell\nu$ and $|V_{ub}$ to 2\% via $B\to \pi\ell\nu$.
    \item[2024] Calculation of $B\to\pi \ell^+\ell^-$ and $B\to K \ell^+\ell^-$ to 2\%.
    \item[2027] Calculation of $|V_{cb}|$ to the sub-percent level via $B\to D^*\ell\nu$.

\subsection{$K_L - K_S$ mass difference}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] Precisely measured quantity that has sensitivity to new physics at an energy scale of $10^4$ TeV.
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate $K_L - K_S$ mass difference with
      a precision exceeding the current experimental value of $3.484
      \pm 0.007 \times  10^{-12}$ MeV.
    \item[Method.] Well understood lattice QCD technique with no
      recognized limitation to the control of all systematic
      errors. GIM cancellation is essential and treatment of the
      charmed quark using QCD perturbation theory introduces 36\%
      errors. The lattice calculation is made diﬀicult by the
      requirement of a lattice spacing smaller than the charm quark
      Compton wave length and a volume suﬀiciently large to accurate
      treat physical mass pions. 
\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[2011] Most accurate KTeV measurement.
    \item[2010-2014] Lattice QCD method devised and first results obtained.
    \item[2014-2021] First results with physical masses and $1/a = 2.38$ MeV obtained, presence of large discretization errors recognized.
    \item[2021-2023] Discretization errors under study and evidence of $a^2$ scaling expected.
    \item[2023-2024] Calculation of the long-distance contribution to
      $\varepsilon_K$ with $1/a = 2.38$ MeV will include extension of
      earlier $\Delta M_K$, calculation increasing statistics.
    \item[2024-2026] Calculation of $\Delta M_K$ with $1/a = 2.8$ GeV
      giving continuum limit result with $< 20$\% errors. 
    \item[2027-2030] Move to $2+1+1$ flavors and $1/a = 3.0$, $4.0$
      GeV and possibly 5 GeV with $<10$\% errors.

\subsection{Direct CP-violation in kaon decays ($\epsilon'$)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] Highly sensitive to new sources of CP that may explain the matter/antimatter asymmetry in the observable Universe. Experimental result with ${\cal O}(10\%)$ precision already available.
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate $\epsilon'$ to a precision exceeding the current 10\% experimental value.        
    \item[Method.] Lattice calculation of $K\to\pi\pi$ matrix elements using 3-flavor weak effective theory in finite-volume allows extraction of infinite-volume amplitudes, $A_2$ \& $A_0$, through Lellouch-L\"uscher methods. Antiperiodic ($A_2$) and novel ``G-parity'' ($A_0$) boundary conditions (BCs) ensure dominance in signal of physical, energy-conserving decay. Non-perturbative renormalization at high energies minimizes systematic error in matching to perturbation theory describing weak interaction physics. Vacuum contributions to $A_0$ require large statistics to adequately resolve. Future calculations aim to reduce systematic errors by incorporating electromagnetism and isospin-breaking effects, and an active charm quark.

\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[1999] First definitive observations of kaon direct CP-violation at KTeV (FermiLab) and NA48 (CERN).
    \item[2001] Final NA48 experimental result published~\cite{NA48:2001bct}.
    \item[1985-2002] Early lattice calculations using quenched QCD and chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) obtained results with large, uncontrolled systematic errors.
    \item[2004] Lattice calculation with dynamical QCD and ChPT~\cite{Li:2008kc}. Large systematic errors due to ChPT discouraged continued usage of this approach.
    \item[2011] Final KTeV experimental result published~\cite{KTeV:2010sng}. Combining experimental results gives current, best determination ${\rm Re}(\epsilon'/\epsilon)=16.6(2.3)\times 10^{-4}$.
    \item[2011] Development of lattice approach for computing $K\to\pi\pi$ decays directly~\cite{Blum:2011pu}.
    \item[2012] First {\it ab initio}, physical calculation of $A_2$~\cite{Blum:2011ng,Blum:2012uk}.
    \item[2015] First continuum-limit calculation of $A_2$~\cite{Blum:2015ywa}. First {\it ab initio}, physical calculation of $A_0$ and $\epsilon'$ using G-parity BCs~\cite{RBC:2015gro}.
    \item[2020] Improved calculation of $A_0$ and $\epsilon'$ with G-parity BCs obtained substantially smaller statistical errors and better control over systematic errors~\cite{RBC:2020kdj}. This, latest result agrees with experiment but has ${\sim}4\times$ the total error.
    \item[2020-2024] Repeat calculation of $A_0$ on finer lattices to reduce/remove ${\cal O}(12\%)$ discretization systematic error.
    \item[2020-2026] Develop new methods to incorporate electromagnetism and isospin-breaking effects, reducing dominant ${\cal O}(23\%)$ systematic error.
    \item[2024-2026] Develop approach to incorporating active charm quarks with controlled discretization errors, reducing an ${\cal O}(12\%)$ systematic error.
    \item[2026-2031] Improved measurements employing new approaches, aiming to match/exceed experimental precision by end of Snowmass '21 period. Potential discovery of tension between experiment and Standard Model may lead to new generation of kaon experiments.

\subsection{Direct $CP$ violation in $K\to\pi\pi$ decays using periodic boundary conditions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] Precise SM prediction of $\varepsilon'$, the measure of direct $CP$ violation in $K\to\pi\pi$ decay, which is very sensitive to new physics. 
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate Re($\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$) with
      a precision exceeding the current experimental value of $1.66(23)\times10^{-3}$, which roughly corresponds to 10\% precision of $A_0$, the decay amplitude with isospin-0 final state.
    \item[Method.] Well understood lattice QCD technique with no
      recognized limitation to the control of all systematic
      errors. The $K\to\pi\pi$ matrix elements with the physical kinematics are to be
      extracted by using the well developed Generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP)
      method~\cite{Luscher:1990ck,Bulava:2011yz}.  The Lellouch-L\"uscher
      formalism~\cite{Lellouch:2000pv} has been used to relate finite- and
      infinite-volume two-pion states in isospin-symmetric calculations but
      needs to be extended for introduction of electromagnetism, which is
      expected to give a significant ($O(20\%)$) impact on $\varepsilon'$
      but has been absent from earlier lattice calculations.  Effects of the
      charm quark and naive discretization effects, which are also significantly
      uncertain for achieving our precision goal at this point, are to be both
      reduced by calculating on finer lattices.
\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[1999] First definitive observations of kaon direct CP-violation at KTeV (FermiLab) and NA48 (CERN).
    \item[2001] Final NA48 experimental result published~\cite{NA48:2001bct}.

    \item[2004] Lattice calculation with dynamical QCD and ChPT~\cite{Li:2008kc}. Large systematic errors due to ChPT discouraged continued usage of this approach.
    \item[2011] Final KTeV experimental result published~\cite{KTeV:2010sng}. Combining experimental results gives current, best determination ${\rm Re}(\varepsilon'/\varepsilon)=16.6(2.3)\times 10^{-4}$.

    \item[2015] First continuum-limit calculation of $A_2$~\cite{Blum:2015ywa}. First {\it ab initio}, physical calculation of $A_0$ and $\varepsilon'$ using G-parity BCs~\cite{RBC:2015gro}.
    \item[2020] Improved calculation of $A_0$ and $\varepsilon'$ with G-parity BCs obtained substantially smaller statistical errors and better control over systematic errors~\cite{RBC:2020kdj}. This, latest result agrees with experiment but has ${\sim}4\times$ the total error.
    \item[2023] Excited two-pion state that corresponds to the final state of energy-conserving $K\to\pi\pi$ decay with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) successfully extracted~\cite{Blum:2023vhp}.  First PBC result for $\varepsilon'$ with $a^{-1}=1.02$~GeV going to be released (paper almost ready).  It agrees with experiment and the G-parity result, but the precision is worse due to fewer configurations and coarser lattice used.
    \item[2022-2024] Continue PBC calculations with more configurations and on a finer lattice of $a^{-1}=1.38$~GeV to obtain a more precise result with reduced statistical and discretization errors.
    \item[2020-2026] Develop new methods to incorporate electromagnetism and isospin-breaking effects, reducing dominant ${\cal O}(20\%)$ systematic error.
    \item[2024-2026] Repeat calculations of $A_0$ on even finer lattices $a^{-1}=1.7, 2.3, 2.7$~GeV. 
    \item[2026-2030] Improved measurements including isospin-breaking and electromagnetic corrections, aiming to match/exceed experimental precision. Potential discovery of a tension between experiment and the SM may prompt a new generation of $\varepsilon'$ experiments.

\subsection{Internal Structure of Mesons and Nucleons}\label{sec:hadstruct}
\begin{itemize}
   \item[Motivation.] A quantitative understanding of the internal
     structure of hadrons, including the distribution of charge, spin
     and mass, in terms of the quarks and gluons of QCD is a central
     goal of nuclear physics, and key to high-energy physics through
     exposing the Standard Model and Beyond-the-Standard Model
     interactions of the quarks and gluons within them.  Flagship
     experiments at JLab\@12 GeV focused on isovector GPDs, and
     understanding the gluonic contributions to hadron structure a
     emblematic problem at the future EIC.
   \item[Long term goal.] First principles calculations of the key
     measures of one-dimensional and three-dimensional hadron
     structure encapsulated in the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs),

     gluonic operators, and their analysis to provide
     Bjorken-$x$-dependent distributions within the
     short-distance-factorization/pseudo-PDF framework.  Exploitation

% Michael Wagman
\subsection{Collins-Soper kernel for TMD evolution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The Collins-Soper kernel relates the transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) of hadrons at different energy scales, which is a crucial non-perturbative input for global analyses to understand the 3D structure of the proton.
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate the Collins-Soper kernel at physical pion mass with a $\sim 10\%$ precision, which can be compared to the experimental results from the Electron-Ion Collider.
    \item[Method.] Lattice calculation and renormalization of the matrix elements of quasi-TMD correlators in a highly boosted hadron state. The quasi-TMD correlators are defined from quark and gluon bilinear operators with a staple-shaped Wilson line extending to the longitudinal direction as the hadron momentum. At large hadron momentum, the quasi-TMD can be factorized into the physical TMD, and the anomalous dimension of their momentum evolution can be perturbatively matched onto the Collins-Soper kernel. Apart from the forward matrix elements for quasi-TMDs, we can also use the TMD wave function, which is a vacuum to hadron amplitude of the quasi-TMD correlator, to extract the Collins-Soper kernel.

\begin{itemize}
