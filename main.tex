\subsection{Muon $g-2$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The muon anomalous magnetic moment, or $g-2$, will be measured by the E989 experiment at Fermilab to the one-per=mille precision level and thus offers an exceptional opportunity to test the standard model if theory can match this precision.
    \item[Long term goal.] The Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative aims to provide a consensus theory value at the same level of precision as the E989 experiment. Only QCD, or hadronic, contributions need improvement to reach this goal.
\item[Method.] Lattice  calculations of correlation functions in QCD for the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) (two-point) and hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) (four-point) are combined with perturbative QED at $O(\alpha^2)$ and $O(\alpha^3)$, respectively, to obtain the leading hadronic contributions.
\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[2021] Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative whitepaper~\cite{Aoyama:2020ynm} released with consensus Standard Model Value based on data-driven HVP and data-driven+lattice HLbL contributions.
    \item[2021] E989 announces first results with 0.48 ppm precision. Combined with BNL 821 (0.54 ppm), yields 4.2 standard deviation discrepancy with theory.
    \item[2021] BMW collaboration computes HVP contribution to 0.75\%, consistent with experiment. 
    \item[2022] USQCD groups Fermilab Lattice/HPQCD/MILC and RBC/UKQCD, $\chi$QCD, Aubin {\it et al.}, and several groups from Europe obtain agreement on the HVP intermediate window which is four standard deviations discrepant with the data-driven value.
    \item[2023] Several groups to update total HVP contribution, including isospin corrections, with sub-percent errors.
    \item[2023] RBC updated HLbL contribution, reaching 12\% error.
    \item[2023] E989 to announce run 2 and 3 combined result, improving precision by a factor of two.
    \item[2024] RBC to reduce error on HLbL contribution by a factor of two.
    \item[2024-25] RBC/UKQCD and FHM reach 1-2 per-mille goal on HVP contribution. 
    \item[2025-26] E989 releases final result with expected precision of $\sim 1.4$ ppm

\subsection{$B$-meson anomalies and CKM unitarity tests}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] $B$-flavor physics offers excellent opportunities for stringent tests of the Standard Model, tests that may lead to the discovery of new physics. In conjunction with refined experimental results, precision lattice-QCD calculations yield precise values of the CKM matrix elements, allowing checks of CKM unitarity and tests of lepton universality. Measurements of rare semileptonic $B$-meson decays (such as $B\to\pi\ell^+\ell^-$, $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$) are promising channels for new-physics searches because their rates are suppressed in the Standard Model.
    \item[Long term goal.] Lattice-QCD calculations go hand-in-hand with experiment.  Thus the long-term goal is to keep pace with the improving experimental precision of each quantity under study.
    \item[Method.] Most calculations work with a combination of hadronic two- and three-point functions, measured at several lattice spacings and quark masses, and with a variety of current operators. 
\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[2014] Calculation of leptonic $B$, $B_s$, $D$, and $D_s$ decay constants to sub-percent accuracy.
    \item[2015] First measurement by CMS/LHCb of the decay $B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$.
    \item[2021] Calculation of $R(D*)$ to 4\%.
    \item[2022] Precise calculation of $|V_{cs}|$ with a QCD error comparable to the current experimental precision and of $|V_{cd}|$ with a QCD error twice that of experiment.
    \item[2024] Calculation of $|V_{cb}|$ to 1\% via $B\to D\ell\nu$ and $|V_{ub}$ to 2\% via $B\to \pi\ell\nu$.
    \item[2024] Calculation of $B\to\pi \ell^+\ell^-$ and $B\to K \ell^+\ell^-$ to 2\%.
    \item[2027] Calculation of $|V_{cb}|$ to the sub-percent level via $B\to D^*\ell\nu$.

\subsection{$K_L$-$K_S$ mass difference}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] This is a precisely measured quantity that is highly sensitivity to new physics 
    at an energy scale of $10^4$ TeV.
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate $K_L - K_S$ mass difference with
    a precision exceeding the current experimental value of $3.484
    \pm 0.007 \times  10^{-12}$ MeV.
    \item[Method.] Well understood lattice QCD technique with no
    recognized limitation to the control of all systematic
    errors. GIM cancellation is essential and treatment of the
    charmed quark using QCD perturbation theory introduces 36\%
    errors. The lattice calculation is made diﬀicult by the
    requirement of a lattice spacing smaller than the charm quark
    Compton wave length and a volume suﬀiciently large to accurate
    treat physical mass pions. 
\item[Timeline:]
    \item[2010] Accurate KTeV result~\cite{KTeV:2010sng}.
    \item[2010-2014] Lattice QCD method devised and first results 
    obtained.~\cite{Christ:2012se, Bai:2014cva}.
    \item[2014-2021] First results with physical masses and $1/a = 2.38$ MeV 
    obtained, presence of large discretization errors recognized~\cite{Bai:2018lrm, 
    Wang:2021twm}.
    \item[2021-2023] Discretization errors studied and evidence of $a^2$ scaling 
    found.
    \item[2023-2024] Calculation of the long-distance contribution to
    $\varepsilon_K$ with $1/a = 2.38$ MeV will include extension of
    earlier $\Delta M_K$, calculation, increasing statistics.
    \item[2024-2026] Calculation of $\Delta M_K$ with $1/a = 2.8$ GeV
    giving continuum limit result with $20$\% errors. 
    \item[2027-2030] Move to $2+1+1$ flavors and $1/a = 3.0$, $4.0$
    GeV and possibly 5 GeV with $10$\% errors. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long distance contribution to $\epsilon_K$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The indirect CP violation parameter $\epsilon_K$ is precisely 
    measured and sensitive to BSM sources of CP violation at high energies. Its 
    accurate standard model (SM) prediction provides a critical test of the KM 
    theory of CP violation.  While 95\% of the SM prediction comes from short 
    distance and is computed to an accuracy approaching 1\%, there is a 5\% 
    contribution from long distances on the scale of the charm quark Compton 
    wavelength and larger that requires a lattice QCD calculation.
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate the long-distance contributions to $\epsilon_K$ 
    to 10\% precision, sufficient to match or exceed the current experimental 
    $\epsilon_K$ precision: $|\epsilon_K|=2.228\pm 0.011 \times 10^{-3}$~\cite{ParticleDataGroup:2022pth}.
    \item[Method.] Well understood lattice QCD technique with no recognized 
    limitation to the control of all systematic errors. GIM cancellation is essential 
    but a logarithmic divergence in the effective long-distance theory requires the 
    perturbative calculation of a low energy constant which becomes systematically 
    more accurate as the matching scale is increased above the charm quark mass.
\item[Timeline:]
    \item[2000] KTeV and NA48 measurements of $\epsilon'$.
    \item[2014-2017] Lattice QCD method devised and first results 
    obtained~\cite{Christ:2015phf}. 
    \item[2023-2024] First calculation with physical quark masses but relatively 
    coarse $1/a=2.38$ GeV lattice spacing (combined with an extension of the
    $\Delta M_K$ calculation with increased statistics).
    \item[2024-2026] Calculation including $\Delta M_K$ with $1/a = 2.8$ GeV 
    giving continuum limit result with $20$\% errors. 
    \item[2027-2030] Move to $2+1+1$ flavors and $1/a = 3.0$, $4.0$
    GeV and possibly 5 GeV with $10$\% errors.

\subsection{Direct CP-violation in kaon decays ($\epsilon'$)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] Highly sensitive to new sources of CP that may explain the matter/antimatter asymmetry in the observable Universe. Experimental result with ${\cal O}(10\%)$ precision already available.
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate $\epsilon'$ to a precision exceeding the current 10\% experimental value.        
    \item[Method.] Lattice calculation of $K\to\pi\pi$ matrix elements using 3-flavor weak effective theory in finite-volume allows extraction of infinite-volume amplitudes, $A_2$ \& $A_0$, through Lellouch-L\"uscher methods. Antiperiodic ($A_2$) and novel ``G-parity'' ($A_0$) boundary conditions (BCs) ensure dominance in signal of physical, energy-conserving decay. Non-perturbative renormalization at high energies minimizes systematic error in matching to perturbation theory describing weak interaction physics. Vacuum contributions to $A_0$ require large statistics to adequately resolve. Future calculations aim to reduce systematic errors by incorporating electromagnetism and isospin-breaking effects, and an active charm quark.

%\begin{itemize}
    \item[1999] First definitive observations of kaon direct CP-violation at KTeV (FermiLab) and NA48 (CERN).

    \item[2004] Lattice calculation with dynamical QCD and ChPT~\cite{Li:2008kc}. Large systematic errors due to ChPT discouraged continued usage of this approach.
    \item[2011] Final KTeV experimental result published~\cite{KTeV:2010sng}. Combining experimental results gives current, best determination ${\rm Re}(\epsilon'/\epsilon)=16.6(2.3)\times 10^{-4}$.

\subsection{Direct $CP$ violation in $K\to\pi\pi$ decays using periodic boundary conditions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] Precise SM prediction of $\varepsilon'$, the measure of direct $CP$ violation in $K\to\pi\pi$ decay, which is very sensitive to new physics. 
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate Re($\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$) with
      a precision exceeding the current experimental value of $1.66(23)\times10^{-3}$, which roughly corresponds to 10\% precision of $A_0$, the decay amplitude with isospin-0 final state.
    \item[Method.] Well understood lattice QCD technique with no
      recognized limitation to the control of all systematic
      errors. The $K\to\pi\pi$ matrix elements with the physical kinematics are to be
      extracted by using the well developed Generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP)
      method~\cite{Luscher:1990ck,Bulava:2011yz}.  The Lellouch-L\"uscher
      formalism~\cite{Lellouch:2000pv} has been used to relate finite- and
      infinite-volume two-pion states in isospin-symmetric calculations but
      needs to be extended for introduction of electromagnetism, which is
      expected to give a significant ($O(20\%)$) impact on $\varepsilon'$
      but has been absent from earlier lattice calculations.  Effects of the
      charm quark and naive discretization effects, which are also significantly
      uncertain for achieving our precision goal at this point, are to be both
      reduced by calculating on finer lattices.
\item[Timeline:]
%\begin{itemize}
    \item[1999] First definitive observations of kaon direct CP-violation at KTeV (FermiLab) and NA48 (CERN).
    \item[2001] Final NA48 experimental result published~\cite{NA48:2001bct}.

    \item[2020] Improved calculation of $A_0$ and $\varepsilon'$ with G-parity BCs obtained substantially smaller statistical errors and better control over systematic errors~\cite{RBC:2020kdj}. This, latest result agrees with experiment but has ${\sim}4\times$ the total error.
    \item[2023] Excited two-pion state that corresponds to the final state of energy-conserving $K\to\pi\pi$ decay with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) successfully extracted~\cite{Blum:2023vhp}.  First PBC result for $\varepsilon'$ with $a^{-1}=1.02$~GeV going to be released (paper almost ready).  It agrees with experiment and the G-parity result, but the precision is worse due to fewer configurations and coarser lattice used.
    \item[2022-2024] Continue PBC calculations with more configurations and on a finer lattice of $a^{-1}=1.38$~GeV to obtain a more precise result with reduced statistical and discretization errors.
    \item[2020-2026] Develop new methods to incorporate electromagnetism and isospin-breaking effects, reducing dominant ${\cal O}(20\%)$ systematic error.  (See item below.)
    \item[2024-2026] Repeat calculations of $A_0$ on even finer lattices $a^{-1}=1.7, 2.3, 2.7$~GeV. 
    \item[2026-2030] Improved measurements including isospin-breaking and electromagnetic corrections, aiming to match/exceed experimental precision. Potential discovery of a tension between experiment and the SM may prompt a new generation of $\varepsilon'$ experiments. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contribution of E\&M and strong isospin breaking to $\epsilon'$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] Because of the $\Delta I=1/2$ rule, the isospin breaking corrections to the direct CP violating parameter $\epsilon'$ are enhanced by a factor of 20, increasing their usual 1\% scale to potentially 20\% and making the uncertainty in these corrections one of the dominant errors in the current standard model prediction of $\epsilon'$.
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate the isospin breaking corrections to $\epsilon'$ to 10\% accuracy removing this as a source of error in the prediction of $\epsilon'$.
    \item[Method.] The addition of electromagnetism adds substantial barriers to the already challenging lattice calculation of $\epsilon'$:  i) The $I=0$ and $I=2$ $\pi\pi$ final states are mixed and the three-particle $\pi\pi\gamma$ state introduced making this a complicated, multi-channel decay. ii)  Standard lattice formulations of QED have substantial finite-volume errors while the successful lattice methods to compute $\epsilon'$ require that the calculation be performed in a volume of limited size.  iii) Adding photons substantially increases the complexity of the quantities being computed, likely requiring the use of computer generated code.
\item[Timeline:]
    \item[2000] KTeV and NA48 measurements of $\epsilon'$
    \item[2017] Non-relativistic method to compute the Coulomb contribution to $\epsilon'$ devised~\cite{Christ:2017pze}.
    \item[2019-2021] Generalize this non-relativisitic method to one that is fully relativistic~\cite{Christ:2021guf}.
    \item[2023-2024] Explore two strategies:  i) Use lattice methods to evaluate the low energy constants needed in a chiral perturbation theory calculation~\cite{Cirigliano:2019cpi} and ii) Extend the Coulomb-gauge approach to include transverse radiation.  Begin a calculation based on the most ;promising method.
    \item[2024-2027] Calculation of isospin breaking contributions to $\epsilon'$ to 30\% accuracy.
    \item[2027-2030] Calculation of isospin breaking contributions to $\epsilon'$ to 10\% accuracy.

\subsection{Two photon exchange contribution to $K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-$}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The $\Delta S=1$ neutral-current rare decay $K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-$ 
    offers an order $G_F^2$ test of the standard model in a process involving the 
    exchange of two $W$ bosons or a $W$ and a $Z$ boson.  However, a background, 
    two-photon exchange process of order $\alpha_{\mathrm{EM}}^2G_F$ contributes 
    at a similar strength to this decay and therefore must be computed if a standard 
    model prediction is to be compared with experiment.
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate this two-photon exchange contribution to 5\% 
    accuracy so that the standard model prediction for the important $G_F^2$ process 
    can be compared to experiment at the 5-10\% precision comparable to the accuracy 
    allowed by the current experimental branching ratio for $K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-$: 
    BR$(K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-) = 6.84\pm0.11\times 10^{-9}$.
    \item[Method.]  This process is similar to the hadronic light-by-light scattering 
    contribution to the muon.  However, new methods are needed because the 
    real-time, complex decay amplitude cannot be directly evaluated in Euclidean 
    space.  However, a well-controlled lattice QCD formulation of this calculation 
    has been developed in which the largest uncontrolled error arises from the 
    $\pi\pi\gamma$ intermedate state whose contribution is expected to be no 
    more than a few percent.

    \item[2000] Accurate measurement of $K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-$ branching 
    ratio~\cite{E871:2000wvm}.

    first results obtained for the simpler $\pi^0\to e^+ e^-$ 
    decay~\cite{Christ:2020dae, Christ:2022rho}.

    $K_L\to\gamma\gamma$ and first results obtained on a single gauge 
    ensemble including only connected graphs with physical quark masses 
    but for a relatively large lattice spacing.~\cite{Zhao:2022pbs, Zhao:2022njd}
    \item[2022-2024] First calculation of the two-photon exchange contribution 
    to $K_L\to\mu^+ \mu^-$ on a single gauge ensemble including only connected 
    graphs with physical quark masses but for a relatively large lattice spacing.
    \item[2025-2028] Extend the calculation to multiple lattice spacings and include 
    disconnected graphs.  Achieve 10\% precision.
    \item[2028-2031] Employ increased statistics and improved methods to 
    achieve the targeted 5\% precision.

\subsection{Nucleon charges}\label{sec:nuccharges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] Nucleon charges $g_{A,S,T}$ arise in many
      low-energy description of nucleons. Flavor diagonal axial
      charges give the contributions of each quark flavor to the
      nucleon spin; tensor charges give the contribution of quark EDM
      to the nucleon EDM; and scalar charges give the pion-nucleon sigma term and strangeness content of the nucleon. 
      Isovector charges give the axial charge $g_A$, a fundamental low-energy constant. The scalar and tensor 
      charges probe novel scalar and tensor interactions at the TeV scale and the tensor charge is also 
      measured in transversity measurements at JLAB. From the matrix elements of 1-link operators, we extract 
      the first moment of distributions, namely momentum fraction, and helicity and transversity moments. These 
      results compare favorably with their extractions from PDFs.
    \item[Long term goal.] To calculate each of these with sub-percent accuracy. 
    \item[Method.] All these require the calculation of connected and disconnected three-point
      functions comprising the insertion of appropriate quark bilinear operators between 
      nucleon source and sink operators. During analysis, remove the
      excited state contributions from these correlation functions to
      get ground state matrix elements that are then decomposed into

\subsubsection{Nucleon electromagnetic form factors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons are well measured experimentally from electron 
      scattering off nuclei.  There is still uncertainty in the calculation of the charge radius of the proton, i.e., 
      a difference from scattering experiments versus muonic hydrogen.  These data are far more precise compared to 
      lattice results and for the foreseeable future will provide a benchmark against which to compare lattice reults to 
      and validate lattice methodology. 
    \item[Long term goal.] To determine the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons to match experimental precision. 
    \item[Method.] First calculate three point functions comprising the insertion of the electromagnetic current
      with all allowed lattice momentum insertion between the nucleon source and sink operators. During analysis, remove 
      the excited state contributions from these correlation functions to get ground state matrix elements that are 
      then decomposed into the desired form factors. The calculation is repeated at multiple values of lattice spacing and 
      pion mass and the results extrapolated to the physical point. 
\item[Timeline:]
    \item[2011--2021] Lattice results showed deviations from the Kelly parameterization of experimental data. 
    \item[2021] NME results agree with Kelly parameterization of experimental data.

\subsubsection{Calculation of high-momentum nucleon form factors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] Any data on nucleon form factors in the range of momentum transfer 5-20 GeV$^2$ will be important for understanding the transition between perturbative and nonperturbative QCD. Such data will also be illuminating for qualitative pictures of nucleons in terms of gluon-dressed constituents or diquarks.
    \item[Long term goal.] Ab initio calculation of such form factors using QCD on a lattice, done with fully controlled systematic errors, is necessary to fill the gap between theory and ongoing experiments. Comparison to experimental results will also reveal and help address any systematic uncertainties in calculations with high-momentum hadron states on a lattice such as calculations of PDFs/GPDs using LaMET and similar approaches.
    \item[Method.] We employ standard lattice techniques together with some methods (e.g., momentum-boosted states) to improve overlap with large-momentum nucleon ground state. We use Breit frame kinematics to reach maximal possible momentum transfer.
\item[Timeline:]
    \item[2016-2023] We have performed calculations of electric and magnetic form factors at three values of lattice spacing and pion masses down to 170 MeV. We have found qualitative agreement in the dependence of the proton form factor ratios $G_{Ep}/G_{Mp}$ and $F_{1p}/F_{2p}$. Some agreement is also evident in the neutron case for $G_{En}/G_{Mn}$. While this agreement is reassuring, the values of the form factors themselves overshoot experiment by factor 2-2.5 for momenta $Q^2$ above 4 GeV$^2$. This is probably due to large contributions of the excited states, since we observe very little dependence on the lattice spacing and the pion mass.
    \item[2023-onward] We plan to increase the statistical precision and extend the range of nucleon correlators in order to improve the control over excited states. In addition, we plan to study the so-called disconnected diagrams (contributions to the isoscalar $(p+n)$ channel) and the leading-order $O(a)$ discretization corrections.
    \item[Relevant experiments] have been performed at CEBAF (JLab@12 GeV) to measure electromagnetic form factors up to 18 GeV$^2$. Results for the magnetic form factor of the proton have been published.

\subsection{Axial Form Factors}\label{sec:axff}

% Rajan Gupta
\subsubsection{NME, PNDME Collaborations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The axial form factors of the nucleons are not well measured experimentally and are
      needed to few percent accuracy to calculate the neutrino-nucleus cross-section for experiments such as DUNE, T2K, etc., to 
      reach their science goals. Large scale simulations of lattice QCD are the current 
      best method to determine these directly from QCD and the methodology for the 
      calculations is mature. 
    \item[Long term goal.] To determine the axial form factors of the nucleons to a few percent 
    \item[Method.] First calculate three point functions comprising the insertion of the axial vector and pseudoscalar currents 
      with allowed lattice  momentum insertion between the nucleon source and sink operators. During analysis, remove 
      the excited state contributions from these correlation functions to get ground state matrix elements that are 
      then decomposed into the desired form factors. The calculation is repeated at multiple values of lattice spacing and 
      pion mass and the results extrapolated to the physical point. 
\item[Timeline:]
    \item[2017] Demonstration that the standard method of analysis gives form factors that do not satisfy PCAC.
    \item[2019] Cause of failure identified to be the contributions of multihadron ($N\pi, N\pi\pi, \ldots$) states 
      and a data driven method to remove them identified.
    \item[2021-2023] Calculations done by a number of lattice collaborations that agree within $1\sigma$ and give results
      with an uncertainty band of $\approx 10\%$.
    \item[2023-2025] NME and PNDME collaborations to reduce the uncertainty band to 3--5\%
    \item[2030] DUNE expected to start taking data.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fermilab Lattice Collaboration}
\begin{itemize}
   \item[Motivation:] Explore feasibility of nucleon-matrix-element calculations with staggered valence quarks, motivated by the neutrino-scattering experiments listed in the previous item.
   \item[Long term goal.] Axial charge $g_A$ and axial form factor with the HISQ action for valence quarks, using MILC's $2+1+1$-flavor ensembles.
   \item[Method:] Staggered fermions have a more complicated symmetry structure than Wilson-like quarks (including domain-wall, twisted-mass, clover, \ldots), making nucleon operators more complicated to construct.  While we have solved this problem for the needed two- and three-point calculations, the approach does not turn out to enjoy the computational savings that staggered fermions provide for mesons.
    \item[Computing:] Work on ensembles with $a\approx0.15$ and 0.12~fm were carried out on USQCD resources (FNAL~LQ1, BNL~Sklake, and BNL~KNL), while work on ensembles with $a\approx0.09$ and 0.06~fm were carried out on LCF resources (NERSC Cori, XSEDE Stampede2, ALCF Theta).
\item[Timeline:]
   \item[2019] Calculation of the nucleon mass at three spacings with physical quark mass~\cite{Lin:2019pia}; at the time (and possibly still), this was the most precise calculation of the nucleon mass.
   \item[2021] Demonstration calculation of the axial charge $g_A$ on the physical-quark-mass HISQ ensemble with $a\approx0.12$~fm~\cite{Lin:2020wko}.
   \item[2023] Calculation of $g_A$ at four spacings ($a\approx0.15$--0.06~fm) with physical quark mass, with update to the nucleon mass.
   \item[2023] Demonstration calculation of the axial charge $g_A$ on the physical-quark-mass HISQ ensemble with $a\approx0.12$~fm~\cite{Lin:2020wko}.
\item[Outlook:] The all-HISQ approach to baryons seems not to be cost-effective enough to justify the overhead in coding and analysis.

\subsection{Nuclean Electric Dipole Moment (nEDM)}\label{sec:nEDM}

% Rajan Gupta
\subsubsection{Contributions of CP violating operators to nucleon electric dipole moment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The CP violation in the CKM quark mixing is too
      small to generate the observed baryon asymmetry in the observed
      universe.  BSM models have new sources of CP violation, each of
      which contribute to nEDM. These interactions and their couplings
      in BSM theories are, using tools of effective field theories,
      written in terms of low energy operators composed of quark and
      gluon fields. The matrix elements of these effective operators
      are only known within a factor of 10 uncertainty.  Lattice QCD
      provides the best method to determine them with control over all
      systematics. Knowing these matrix elements, one can use the bound
      [eventually value] of nEDM to constrain the CP violating
      couplings in various BSM theories.  These viable BSM models can
      then be analyzed to determine if they are further consistent
      with the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry.
    \item[Long term goal.] To calculate the matrix elements of all low
      energy effective operators of dimension six 
      and smaller that contribute to the nucleon electric dipole moment. 
    \item[Method.] This requires calculating three- and four- point
      functions comprising the insertion of the electromagnetic
      current with finite CP violating operators with finite momentum
      insertion between the nucleon source and sink operators to be
      able to take the zero momentum limit.  During analysis, remove
      the excited state contributions from these correlation functions
      to get ground state matrix elements that are then decomposed
      into the desired form factors of which $F_3$ is the desired CP
      violating one from which $d_n = F_3(0)/2 M_N \epsilon$, where
      $\epsilon $ is the coupling strength of the operator. Repeat the
      calculation at multiple values of lattice spacing and pion mass
      and extrapolate the results to the physical point.
\item[Timeline:]
    \item[Pre 2017] The first lattice calculations set up the
      framework but did not include a phase in the definition of the
      nucleon spinor, which lead to wrong results.  
    \item[2017-2023] Focus on error reduction in the extraction of
      $F_3$ parameterization of experimental data. Understand and remove 
      the contributions of multihadron ($N\pi,
      N\pi\pi, \ldots$) states. 
    \item[2021-2023] Calculations from a number of collaboration for
      the Theta term with different levels of control over signal and
      systematics.  
    \item[2023-2025] To get a robust signal at near physical quark masses. 
    \item[2030] Expect a factor of 10 reduction in the upper bound on
      neutron EDM and mabe a value.  
\end{itemize}

% Sergey Syritsyn
\subsubsection{Quark-gluon CP violating contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] Neutron and proton electric dipole moments
      (EDMs) are the most precise probes of CP violation in QCD and
      beyond-the SM physics. The latter is important for finding
      plausible scenarios of baryogenesis and understanding the origin
      of the nuclear matter. Knowing the magnitude of neutron EDM
      induced by different sources of CP violation is crucial to using
      experimental bounds to constrain new types of CP-violating
      interactions. 
    \item[Long term goal] is finding contributions to nucleon EDMs of
      effective quark-gluon CPv operators that may be induced by new
      physics. These effective CPv interactions are quark EDMs, quark
      and gluon chromo-EDMs, QCD theta-term, and 4-quark
      interactions. 
    \item[Method.] We use the background-field method in which the
      energy (mass) of a nucleon is shifted due to induced EDM. This
      method may have comparative advantage compared to computing
      electric dipole form factors that have to be extrapolated to the
      forward limit. In addition, it may be simpler to implement in
      the case of four-quark operators. 
\item[Timeline:]
    \item[2016-2023] We have successfully demonstrated that the
      background field method is at least comparable in precision to
      the traditional method of computing neutron EDM induced by the
      QCD theta-term.We have implemented sophisticated sampling
      techniques combining variable precision and low-lying eigenmode
      approximation of the Dirac equation. We have performed
      calculation of the neutron EDM using chirally-symmetric
      fermions. 
    \item[2023-onward] We plan to extend our calculations of
      theta-QCD-induced neutron EDM to the physical point, where the
      low-eigenmode approximation is expected to be even more
      efficient. We also plan to start calculations involving 4-quark
      CPv operators. 
    \item[Experiments] are expected to improve bounds on neutron EDMs
      within the current decade. It is particularly important to
      improve our theoretical knowledge of neutron EDM contributions
      in the same time frame in order to constrain proposed models of
      novel CP-violating interactions and baryogenesis scenarios.

\subsection{Collins-Soper kernel for TMD evolution}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The Collins-Soper kernel relates the
      transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs) of hadrons at
      different energy scales, which is a crucial non-perturbative
      input for global analyses to understand the 3D structure of the

    \item[Method.] Lattice calculation and renormalization of the

      and gluon bilinear operators with a staple-shaped Wilson line
      extending to the longitudinal direction as the hadron
      momentum. At large hadron momentum, the quasi-TMD can be
      factorized into the physical TMD, and the anomalous dimension of
      their momentum evolution can be perturbatively matched onto the
      Collins-Soper kernel. Apart from the forward matrix elements for
      quasi-TMDs, we can also use the TMD wave function, which is a
      vacuum to hadron amplitude of the quasi-TMD correlator, to

\begin{itemize}
\item[Motivation.] The proton spin puzzle is a touchstone of our
understanding of proton structure. Compared to the parton spin
contributions, the parton OAM contributions are less straightforward
to access directly, requiring the evaluation of either generalized

\subsection{Neutrino-nucleon Scattering from the Hadronic Tensor}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[Motivation.] The formalism of hadronic tensor in lattice QCD~\cite{Liu:1993cv,Liu:1999ak} offers an opportunity to directly evaluate the cross-sections of neutrino-nucleon scattering in the elastic and resonance regions and potentially in the shallow- and deep-inelastic regions as well. The lattice calculation of the neutrino-nucleon scattering cross-sections can be an input for the neutrino-nucleus scattering calculation. The latter is needed for neutrino experiments at DUNE to provide theoretical constraints when analyzing data from neutrino oscillation experiments.
    \item[Long term goal.] Calculate precise neutrino-nucleon scattering cross-sections in all the neutrino energy regions from the threshold to 7 GeV. This should help improve the theoretical understanding of the neutrino-nucleus scattering cross-sections and maximize the discovery potential of neutrino oscillation experiments.

\section{Extreme matter}\label{sec:extreme}

% Peter Petreczky
\subsection{QCD phase diagram}\label{sec:qcdphase}
\begin{itemize}
  \item[Motivation.] The aim of ultra-relativistic heavy ion
    collisions is to study strongly interacting matter at high
    temperatures. There is a large ongoing experimental program at
    RHIC in BNL and LHC at CERN dedicated to this. Lattice QCD
    calculations provide the necessary input for theoretical
    interpretation of heavy ion experiments. 

 \item[Long term goal.] The goal of lattice QCD calculations is to
      map out the QCD phase diagram as function of the temperature at
      zero and moderately high baryon density, calculate the QCD
      equation of state and estimate spectral functions that are
      needed for heavy flavor and electromagnetic probes of the matter
      produced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion
      collisions. \item[Method.] Calculations are performed using
      highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action in 2+1 flavor QCD
      with physical strange quark mass, $m_s$ and various light quark
      masses, $m_l$,  around its physical value of $m_l=m_s/27$. In
      some case calculations are performed for larger value of
      $m_l$. For the calculations of the spectral function sometimes
      values $m_l=m_s/5$ are used while for exploring the chiral
      aspects of the transition smaller than physical values of $m_l$
      are used. 

  \item[Timeline:]
   \item[2011-2014] The HotQCD collaboration successfully determined
     the chiral crossover temperature and QCD equation of state in the
     continuum limit. 
   \item[2014-2021] The HotQCD collaboration determined the chiral
     crossover temperature, the QCD equation of state and fluctuations
     of conserved charges at non-zero density, which was essential
     input for the RHIC BES program. In particular these results have
     been used by the BEST DOE topical collaboration.
   \item[2019-2023] Calculations of the bottomonium properties and the
     heavy quark potential have been performed at nearly physical
     light quark masses on lattices with temporal extent
     $N_{\tau}=12$. The heavy quark diffusion coefficient has been
     calculated in 2+1 flavor QCD for the first time at
     $m_l=m_s/5$. All these calculations are important for the
     interpretation of the open and hidden heavy flavor production in
     heavy ion experiments at RHIC and LHC, including START, sPHENIX,
     ALICE, CMS and ATLAS.
   \item[2023-2027] Our goal in the future is to calculate quarkonium
     in-medium properties and the heavy quark diffusion coefficient in
     the continuum limit for physical light quark masses.
   \item[2023-2035] Heavy flavor probes will be one of the driving
     themes of heavy ion experiments at RHIC and LHC. The sPHENX and
     STAR experiments will collect new data in 2023-2025. The analysis
     of these data will probably last till 2028. The LHC heavy ion
     experiments are planned to run till at least 2035. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Energy Frontier}\label{sec:energy}


INTENSITY FRONTIER  ( QCD strong coupling, as defined at the Z-pole)

\begin{itemize}
	\item[Motivation.]  The most precise lattice determination of the QCD strong coupling $\alpha_s$  comes from the european Alpha collaboration but  it should require independent and important  cross-validation. Two  USQCD  groups are working toward  this goal.
	\item[Long term goal.] The QCD strong coupling $\alpha_s$, as defined at the Z-pole, is equivalent to the long term goal to determine $\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}$  in physical units with very high precision. Credible and high precision cross-validation  of this goal  is motivated by the emergence of  the required new lattice  technology for the long-term goal.
	\item[Method.]  The application of gradient flow based scale-dependent renormalization of $\alpha_s(\mu=1/\sqrt{8t})$ at flow time scale $t$ on lattices extended to  infinite space-time provides the new technology. 
	\item[Timeline:]
	\item[2012] The LatHC collaboration introduces the gradient flow based step $\beta$-function where the scale is set by the size of the physical volume Fodor:2012td. The method  has been extended  applied to high precision QCD and to BSM models. 
	\item[2017-2018] The LatHC collaboration introduces and tests in the sextet BSM model the  gradient flow based  $\beta$-function for the renormalized coupling at flow time scale $t$ where the lattice is extended to infinite volume.  The method is tested at a single renormalized gauge coupling \cite{Fodor:2017die}. 
	\item[2019-2020] The new paradigm was extended to predict the entire $\beta$ function from UV to IR. This approach was tested in two-flavor QCD with massless fermions\cite{Hasenfratz:2019hpg} and in multiflavor QCD with ten and twelve flavors.
	\item[2022-2023] In the SU(3) Yang-Mills limit of quenched QCD it was shown by two USQCD groups that the new method is a competitive high-precision match to the earlier method of the Alpha collaboration \cite{Hasenfratz:2023bok,Wong:2023jvr}. The combined high accuracy is in signifcant tension with any other lattice method.
		\item[2023-2024]  Ongoing and future work of two USQCD groups is trying the reproduce the success of their quenched QCD results with three massless quark flavors in QCD to achieve the stated  goal. 
	
\end{itemize}

ENERGY FRONTIER  ( sextet model and ten-flavor QCD)

\begin{itemize}
	\item[Motivation.]  Gauge theories with massless fermions and large number of flavors, or in higher fermion representations, become near-conformal with the signal of an emergent dilaton. The effetive field theory description of this dilaton is an important challenge to understand as one of the most important clues to the conformal window.
   	\item[Method.] The effective field theory description of this dilaton is an important challenge to understand as one of the most significant clues to the conformal window. The  effective dilaton theories of the two models are tested in the p-regime and epsilon regime of the chirally broken phase near conformality.
	\item[Timeline:]
\item[2018-2020]   	The LatHC collaboration presents dilaton effecive field theory analysis  of  the sextet model. Similar tests were obtained in the eight-flavor model based on the data of the LSD collaboration.
\item[2023-2024]   There are ongoing tests in the sextet model and in the ten-flavor model to further develop the effective dilaton theory based on the anomalous dimension of composite four-fermion operators.

   	
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Running coupling, $\alpha_s(M_Z)$, and non-perturbative renormalization of QCD}
\begin{itemize}
   \item[Motivation.] Determining the QCD running coupling, the $\Lambda$ parameter, and the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ are essential to connect lattice calculations to continuum renormalization schemes. 
   \item[Long term goal.] Lattice calculations can determine the $\Lambda_{QCD}$  from the infrared lattice scale to high energies where perturbative connection to the ${\overline {MS}}$ scheme is possible. The goal is to determine the renormalization group $\beta$ function for the $N_f=0$ Yang-Mills system and for  $N_f=2$ and 3 flavor QCD. Using the decoupling method these determinations can be connected, providing further verification of the flavor number dependence.
   \item[Method.] In recent years the continuous $\beta$ function method, originally developed to study the RG properties of near-conformal systems, proved to be a very reliable approach. Several groups use the method to achive the stated goals. Calculations with  different lattice actions and lattice fermions  provide an other level of control over this important quantity.
\item[Timeline:] 
   \item[2015-2021] Development of the continuous $\beta$ function method (see next section)
   \item[2021-2023] First results for the $N_f=0$ system are published. Calculations of the $N_f=2$ and 3 systems have started. 
   \item[2023-2025] First published result for $N_f=2$ is expected in 2023, followed by more precise calculations for both $N_f=2$ and 3.
   
\end{itemize}
